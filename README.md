# PRO701
This repository contains the work I have done as part of the PRO701 course through NMIT's (Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology) Bachelor of IT (Information Technology).

During the PRO701 NMIT course I built a web app that can display a family tree chart (see below), which is built dynamically out of a large volume of data.
This data is created by a generator that was also built by me for the purpose of this project.

#### Demonstration of interacting with the family tree and response time.
